## Details
This Qt C++ Embedded Linux software, running on the DE10-Nano Development Kit (LXDE OS), is designed to monitor the vibrations of newly built bridges on different loads in the northern areas of Pakistan. It is used to evaluate the strength of bridges. It monitors and logs values in CSV file from various connected sensors, including accelerometers, differential telemetry sensors, and bipolar voltage sensors. The system can read data from 48 channels at a sampling rate of 10 Hz, with each channel being fully configurable and calibration factors stored for accuracy. The software features a dedicated window for monitoring four channels in a line-plot view, utilizing the third-party library QCustomPlot. This project provided valuable experience in the Qt framework, including the use of enumerations, structures, threading, and user preference settings, highlighting its practical application and learning benefits.

### Tools & Technologies: 
Qt C++ Framework version 5.12, QWidgetApplication, Open-Source
